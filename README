		-----------------------------
		 Useful Terminal I/O Library
		-----------------------------

1. Overview

utio is an alternative (to curses) implementation for terminfo-described
terminal access.

2. Compilation

You will need the uSTL library 0.8 or later to compile utio.
uSTL can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ustl

./configure --help will list available configuration options.

% ./configure
% make
% make install

Optionally, if you have doxygen, you can build a reference manual with:

% make html

Running utio applications requires the terminfo database. No, termcap
is not the same as terminfo; the latter is a collection of binary
files under /usr/share/terminfo. No, files under /usr/share/tabset
on BSD systems are not terminfo files either.

3. Usage

See docs/index.html for API description.
