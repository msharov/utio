<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>
"But I want this text to be green!" So began my complaint about the lack
of console capabilities in Linux. Many people have made this complaint
before and were given the same answer I received: "use curses". Now,
curses is a pretty ugly beast, written decades ago when dumb terminals
existed and terminal control sequences were actually interpreted by
sundry horrible hardware designed by complete idiots (or so it seems
in hindsight). Hardware that supported only a couple of colors, or a
limited number of color combinations (oh, the horror!). Hardware that
sometimes gave you nothing but the newline code to work with. As a result
of pandering to all these designs, curses became what it is now. There
is no need to blame its developers; I am sure that neither you nor I
could have done better with the specifications they were given.
</p><p>
In the modern times, however, text consoles are a very different environment.
Monochrome monitors, dumb vt100 terminals, and all such weird hardware has
been dumped into museums, landfills, or big company junk rooms. Consoles
are all emulated now, and support only several capability sets. There are
the OS default text console, which on Linux is called "linux", and a couple
of X terminal emulators, which try to be compatible with xterm. All of them
support color text. None of them have limited "color pairs" number. All have
decent positioning, cursor movement, clearing, drawing, and Unicode text
writing capabilities. As a result, there is simply no reason to work with
them in the same ugly manner that was necessary to support the hundreds of
braindead terminal types that existed back in the middle of last century.
</p><p>
And so I wrote this library, which has basically the same functionality as
curses, but with a different approach. Whereas curses made no assumptions
regarding what sort of an application you want to write, I'm assuming you
want it to look like all the text UIs have looked since the glory days of
DOS. That is, they draw on the screen only when you tell them to, instead
of echoing every character the user types. They don't have to buffer the
input to save to cost of transmitting a character over an ancient 128 baud
line. They get the escape key as soon as it is pressed, instead of seeing
if the user is so 5331 that he can type his own terminal conrol codes. They
know how to decode arrow key codes instead of making you write your own code
to do it. And so on.
</p><p>
My other concern with curses is that it is a pure C library. Now that C++
specification is stable (unlike at the time when curses was written) and
is fully supported on every platform in existence, there is absolutely no
reason to use plain C for any application over a few hundred lines. C code
makes it really hard to create good designs for your software, and as a
result, pretty much all large C projects (like the Linux kernel, for example)
either are converting to C++ or are manually implementing C++ features in C
(like the Linux kernel does when it builds what are effectively C++ vtables
for its drivers). This library is entirely in C++, with interfaces packed
into objects, as they are supposed to be, errors handled with exceptions,
and cleanup taken care of by destructors.
</p>

<h2><a name="CTerminfo">CTerminfo</a></h2>

<p>
"But I want this text to be red!" Is the simplest terminal capability
you could ask for. If you have an application that just prints stuff out
to the screen, like, say, a compiler, you might not necessarily want to
use a fully featured windowing system just to make the error messages
print out red. In curses you'd have to create a window, keep track of
rotating the lines through the screen, and worry a lot about how to
remember where the dirty areas are. <var>CTerminfo</var> answers this problem with
a simple stream-based interface that lets you directly print terminal
capabilities, taking care of all those little details, like having to
set the bold attribute to get all 16 colors. Here's a simple example:
</p>
<pre>
    CTerminfo ti;
    ti.Load();
    cout &lt;&lt; ti.Color(red) &lt;&lt; "Error: can't open file x" &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>
<p>
The second (optional) argument to Color sets the background color. See
EColor enum in <tt>ticonst.h</tt> for available color values. With
color_Preserve value you can keep the fancy backgrounds provided by
some graphical terminal emulators (ETerm). You can also draw simple
stuff like lines (HLine, VLine) and boxes (Box), positioned where you
want them (MoveTo), which is useful for making progress displays nicer
than printing "23% complete" every few seconds. You can clear the screen
(Clear) or just parts of it (Bar). You can get ASCII art from files and
dump it on the screen (Image). In other words, do all those things that
DOS programmers had forever; things that let them develop text editors,
IDEs (Borland), file managers (Norton Commander), and many wonderful text
mode games like zzt. <var>CTerminfo</var> also provides the ability to directly
use terminal capabilities, if there is something you really need. You
can get the terminfo-given values for booleans (GetBoolean), numbers
(GetNumber), or strings (GetString). Take a look at <tt>ticonst.h</tt>
for supported capability names.
</p><p>
There are a couple of things you need to remember when working with this
class. First, because many terminfo capabilities are actually programs,
some output strings must be built at runtime. <var>CTerminfo</var>
uses an internal buffer to store the output before returning it. This
allows all operations to work inline instead of requiring you to pass a
buffer for each one. What this means to you is that you should not store
pointers to the returned values. If you need to do it, copy it into your
own string object. However, you can't use it again because of the second
caveat, which is that the object keeps the current terminal state. So
if you set the color to red and the set the color to red again, nothing
will be written. This is a good thing, since it reduces the amount of
control code the kernel has to parse, but it means you should not write
your own control sequences. If you feel the need to force a write, you
can reset the saved state with <var>ResetState</var>. I should also note
that while this behaviour is not thread-safe, that it is so is irrelevant
since you can't print to the terminal from different threads and expect
consistent results. The terminal keeps state too and therefore must be
used from one thread only.
</p><p>
The terminal description record is loaded from the terminfo database,
usually located under /usr/share/terminfo. The database location may be
overridden by setting <var>TERMINFO</var> environment variable to the
correct location. If <tt>Load</tt> is called without an argument (which
can give a specific terminal name), as in the example listing above, the
terminal name is obtained from the <var>TERM</var> environment variable.
If neither is set, the name defaults to "linux", which may or may not be
correct. Loading errors are reported by throwing appropriate exceptions.
</p>

<h2><a name="CGC">CGC</a></h2>

<p>
While <var>CTerminfo</var> is a decent interface for a simple, output-only
application, a more sophisticated approach is usually desired for a truly
interactive one. A well-designed, user friendly application would want
to have more control over the screen contents, implementing some type
of an event-driven windowing system. It would usually have a lot of
stuff on the screen and so would want to optimize the output to redraw
only the areas changed since the last update. This results in faster,
more responsive application, since parsing the terminal control strings
is a major bottleneck on the console. Furthermore, a windowing system
always needs some type of a backbuffer into which each window can draw,
to allow proper clipping and overlapping window support without making
each window write its own code for them.
</p><p>
For all these purposes, this library provides the <var>CGC</var> class,
roughly equivalent to the <var>WINDOW</var> structure in curses, and
to the drawing context in most graphical UI environments. It contains
a memory buffer into which all the drawing operations go. When you
have finished writing into it, it can be blitted to the screen with
the <var>Image</var> command in <var>CTerminfo</var>. The intended use,
however is a triple-buffer rotating system that writes only differences
between updates. Here is an example of how it might work:
</p>
<pre>
    CGC gc;			// This is where the code draws.
    CGC scr;			// This contains the current contents of the screen.

    // Make both the same size as the screen.
    gc.Resize (m_TI.Width(), m_TI.Height());
    scr.Resize (m_TI.Width(), m_TI.Height());

    while (inEventLoop) {
	Draw (gc);		// Draws everything that should be on the screen.
	gc.MakeDiffFrom (scr);	// Only the differences need to be written, so find them.
	// gc now has only new stuff, the rest is zeroed out, and isn't drawn.
	cout &lt;&lt; m_TI.Image (0, 0, gc.Width(), gc.Height(), gc.Canvas().begin());
	cout.flush();
	screen.Image (gc);	// Now apply the same diff to the screen cache.
	gc.Image (screen);	// ... and copy it back for a fresh start.
	WaitForEvent();
    }
</pre>

<h2><a name="CKeyboard">CKeyboard</a></h2>

<p>
An interactive application is worthless if you can't interact with it,
so some code is invariably required to accept keystrokes from the user
and to convert them to some usable values. If you have ever tried to
read the keyboard on a Linux console, you know just how much of a pain
it is. Instead of giving you a keycode for a key, it gives you escape
sequences. Sequences that are different for every terminal. Modifier keys
like Ctrl, Alt, or Shift, are intercepted by the kernel and translated
into what it thinks are the right things to print on the screen. Yes,
you can actually disable this translation and put the terminal in RAW
mode, but woe be to you if anything happens to your application before
it is able to unset it. The "cbreak" mode, used by curses and this
library, is not too bad. If your application crashes, you can still
type and restore normal operation. If you were in RAW mode though,
only a hardware reboot will fix the computer, since you will not be
able to type anything at all.  Another downside of RAW mode is that
the keyboard layout has to be manually loaded and interpreted, which
would greatly increase the code size of this library.  Thankfully,
it is possible to run in semi-normal "cooked" mode and still interpret
keycodes correctly. That is what <var>CKeyboard</var> is for.
</p>
<pre>
    m_Kb.Open (m_TI);	// Also places the terminal in UI-friendly mode.
    wchar_t key = 0;
    CKeyboard::metastate_t meta;
    while (key != 'q') {
	key = m_Kb.GetKey (&amp;meta);	// Synchronous call.
	// ... do whatever with key ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
Look in <tt>ticonst.h</tt> for EKeyDataValue enum of possible return codes.
They are what will be returned instead of the escape sequences. Metakey
state is in <var>meta</var> (which is an optional argument, in case you
don't care about it). The above example demonstrates synchronous call
usage. If you give <var>GetKey</var> <kbd>false</kbd> as a second argument,
the call will return immediately with 0 if there is nothing to read. Then
you can continue with your idle loop or do a <var>select</var> call on
whatever file descriptors you are currently watching.
</p><p>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> It is very important to allow
<var>CKeyboard</var> to call its destructor (or to manually call
<var>LeaveUIMode</var>) before exiting. If it fails to do so, the keyboard
remains in the UI state and the shell will not be very usable. There
will be no echo, no cursor, and no scrollback. (You can manually fix it
with <kbd>"stty sane"</kbd> and <kbd>"echo ^v ESC c"</kbd>) This cleanup
problem is common to all UI environments, be it curses, console, the
framebuffer, or X. Crashing the UI environment without cleanup is a very
bad idea. It's also pretty bad for your objects in general, possibly
resulting in leaking resources, memory, IPC resources, etc. Most object
oriented UI frameworks take care of this for you in some way. Some require
an application object, which is guaranteed destructed on exit; you can see
an example implementation of this approach in the demo directory. Some
just register <var>atexit()</var> functions to clean up anything that
really needs to be cleaned up. And then there are those who just assume
nothing bad will ever happen and that the user knows how to reboot. Try
not to fall into the last category.

<h2><a name="Build">How to build it</a></h2>

<p>
At this point I'm going to mention that this project is no longer being
developed. I have discovered that terminfo entries are just plain
wrong in many cases and nobody is particularly interested in fixing
them. Specific terminfo entries must be written for currently existing
terminal emulators, including xterm, which no longer conforms to the
original terminfo. I am not interested in doing it due to the amount
of work involved, but you are, of course, welcome to try. If you do,
you may want to take over this project. Anyway...
</p><p>
Building this library is a fairly standard procedure. Download the package,
unpack it into its directory. If you like living dangerously, you can get the
current development branch by git at
<a href="http://utio.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=utio">git://utio.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/utio/utio</a>.
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">gcc compiler</a> with C++ support. Version 3 or later is highly recommended.</li>
    <li>POSIX-compatible libc. Anything made in the last 5 years should work.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ustl">uSTL</a> library version 1.0 or higher.</li>
    <li>The terminfo database. In the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</a> package, if your distribution doesn't provide it.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</pre>
<p>
<kbd>./configure --help</kbd> lists configuration options, like setting an
installation path other than <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>. To use the library,
include <kbd>utio.h</kbd> and link with <kbd>-lutio</kbd>. Look at the
example programs in the <kbd>demo</kbd> directory to start with something
that is known to work.
