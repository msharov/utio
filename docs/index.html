<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
This library implements a simple C++ API for using terminfo in linux
terminals for those situations where using curses is inconvenient. UTIO
can add colors to your text output, directly use some terminfo capabilities
without going into fullscreen mode, and, when you do want fullscreen mode,
it better integrates into modern event-driven designs.
</p>

<h2 id="Build">How to build it</h2>
<p>
Download the package from
<a href="https://github.com/msharov/utio/releases/latest">https://github.com/msharov/utio/releases/latest</a>.
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:
C++11 compiler, such as gcc 4.6+, the
<a href="https://github.com/msharov/ustl/releases/latest">uSTL</a>
library version 2.2+, and, if your distribution does not
provide the terminfo database, it can be downloaded with the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</a>
package.
</p>
<pre>
    % ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
<p>
<kbd>./configure --help</kbd> lists configuration options, like setting an
installation path other than <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>. To use the library,
include <kbd>utio.h</kbd> and link with <kbd>-lutio</kbd>. Look at the
example programs in the <kbd>text</kbd> directory to start with something
that is known to work.
</p>

<h2 id="CTerminfo">CTerminfo</h2>
<p>
"But I want this text to be red!" Is the simplest terminal capability
you could ask for. If you have an application that just prints stuff out
to the screen, like, say, a compiler, you might not necessarily want to
use a fully featured windowing system just to make the error messages
print out red. In curses you'd have to create a window and keep track
of rotating the lines through the screen. <var>CTerminfo</var> answers
this problem with a simple stream-based interface that lets you directly
print terminal capabilities, taking care of all those little details,
like having to set the bold attribute to get all 16 colors. Here's a
simple example:
</p><pre>
    CTerminfo ti;
    ti.Load();
    cout &lt;&lt; ti.Color(red) &lt;&lt; "Error: can't open file x" &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre><p>
The second (optional) argument to Color sets the background
color. See <tt>EColor</tt> enum in <tt>ticonst.h</tt> for available
color values. With <tt>color_Preserve</tt> value you can keep the
fancy backgrounds provided by some graphical terminal emulators
(ETerm). You can also draw simple stuff like lines (HLine, VLine)
and boxes (Box), positioned where you want them (MoveTo), which is
useful for making progress displays nicer than printing "23% complete"
every few seconds. You can clear the screen (Clear) or just parts of
it (Bar). You can get ASCII art from files and dump it on the screen
(Image). In other words, do all those things that DOS programmers had
forever; things that let them develop text editors, IDEs (Borland),
file managers (Norton Commander), and many wonderful text mode games
like zzt. <var>CTerminfo</var> also provides the ability to directly
use terminal capabilities, if there is something you really need. You
can get the terminfo-given values for booleans (GetBoolean), numbers
(GetNumber), or strings (GetString). Take a look at <tt>ticonst.h</tt>
for supported capability names.
</p><p>
There are a couple of things you need to remember when working with this
class. First, because many terminfo capabilities are actually programs,
some output strings must be built at runtime. <var>CTerminfo</var>
uses an internal buffer to store the output before returning it. This
allows all operations to work inline instead of requiring you to pass a
buffer for each one. What this means to you is that you should not store
pointers to the returned values. If you need to do it, copy it into your
own string object. However, you can't use it again because of the second
caveat, which is that the object keeps the current terminal state. So
if you set the color to red and the set the color to red again, nothing
will be written. This is a good thing, since it reduces the amount of
control code the kernel has to parse, but it means you should not write
your own control sequences. If you feel the need to force a write, you
can reset the saved state with <var>ResetState</var>. I should also note
that while this behaviour is not thread-safe, that it is so is irrelevant
since you can't print to the terminal from different threads and expect
consistent results. The terminal keeps state too and therefore must be
used from one thread only.
</p><p>
The terminal description record is loaded from the terminfo database,
usually located under <tt>/usr/share/terminfo</tt>. The database
location may be overridden by setting <var>TERMINFO</var> environment
variable to the correct location. If <tt>Load</tt> is called without an
argument (which can give a specific terminal name), as in the example
listing above, the terminal name is obtained from the <var>TERM</var>
environment variable.  If neither is set, the name defaults to "linux",
which may or may not be correct. Loading errors are reported by throwing
appropriate exceptions.
</p>

<h2 id="CGC">CGC</h2>
<p>
While <var>CTerminfo</var> is a decent interface for a simple, output-only
application, a more sophisticated approach is usually desired for a truly
interactive one. A well-designed, user friendly application would want
to have more control over the screen contents, implementing some type
of an event-driven windowing system. It would usually have a lot of
stuff on the screen and so would want to optimize the output to redraw
only the areas changed since the last update. This results in faster,
more responsive application, since parsing the terminal control strings
is a major bottleneck on the console. Furthermore, a windowing system
always needs some type of a backbuffer into which each window can draw,
to allow proper clipping and overlapping window support without making
each window write its own code for them.
</p><p>
For all these purposes, this library provides the <var>CGC</var> class,
roughly equivalent to the <var>WINDOW</var> structure in curses, and
to the drawing context in most graphical UI environments. It contains
a memory buffer into which all the drawing operations go. When you
have finished writing into it, it can be blitted to the screen with
the <var>Image</var> command in <var>CTerminfo</var>. The intended use,
however is a triple-buffer rotating system that writes only differences
between updates. Here is an example of how it might work:
</p><pre>
    CTerminal ti;
    ti.Load();

    CGC gc,		// This is where the code draws.
	scr;		// This contains the current contents of the screen.

    // Make both the same size as the screen.
    gc.Resize (ti.Width(), ti.Height());
    scr.Resize (ti.Width(), ti.Height());

    while (inEventLoop) {
	Draw (gc);		// Draws everything that should be on the screen.
	gc.MakeDiffFrom (scr);	// Only the differences need to be written, so find them.
	// gc now has only new stuff, the rest is zeroed out, and isn't drawn.
	cout &lt;&lt; ti.Image (0, 0, gc.Width(), gc.Height(), gc.Canvas().begin());
	cout.flush();
	screen.Image (gc);	// Now apply the same diff to the screen cache.
	gc.Image (screen);	// ... and copy it back for a fresh start.
	WaitForEvent();
    }
</pre>

<h2 id="CKeyboard">CKeyboard</h2>
<p>
An interactive application is worthless if you can't interact with it,
so some code is invariably required to accept keystrokes from the user
and to convert them to some usable values. If you have ever tried to
read the keyboard on a Linux console, you know just how much of a pain
it is. Instead of giving you a keycode for a key, it gives you escape
sequences. Sequences that are different for every terminal. Modifier keys
like Ctrl, Alt, or Shift, are intercepted by the kernel and translated
into what it thinks are the right things to print on the screen. Yes,
you can actually disable this translation and put the terminal in RAW
mode, but woe be to you if anything happens to your application before
it is able to unset it. The "cbreak" mode, used by curses and this
library, is not too bad. If your application crashes, you can still
type and restore normal operation. If you were in RAW mode though,
only a hardware reboot will fix the computer, since you will not be
able to type anything at all.  Another downside of RAW mode is that
the keyboard layout has to be manually loaded and interpreted, which
would greatly increase the code size of this library.  Thankfully,
it is possible to run in semi-normal "cooked" mode and still interpret
keycodes correctly. That is what <var>CKeyboard</var> is for.
</p><pre>
    CTerminfo ti;
    ti.Load();
    CKeyboard kb;
    kb.Open (ti);	// Also places the terminal in UI-friendly mode.
    wchar_t key = 0;
    while (key != 'q') {
	CKeyboard::metastate_t meta;
	key = kb.GetKey (&amp;meta);	// Synchronous call.
	// ... do whatever with key ...
    }
</pre><p>
Look in <tt>ticonst.h</tt> for EKeyDataValue enum of possible return codes.
They are what will be returned instead of the escape sequences. Metakey
state is in <var>meta</var> (which is an optional argument, in case you
don't care about it). The above example demonstrates synchronous call
usage. If you give <var>GetKey</var> <kbd>false</kbd> as a second argument,
the call will return immediately with 0 if there is nothing to read. Then
you can continue with your idle loop or do a <var>select</var> call on
whatever file descriptors you are currently watching.
</p><p>
It is important to allow <var>CKeyboard</var> to call its destructor
(or to manually call <var>LeaveUIMode</var>) before exiting. If it fails
to do so, the keyboard remains in the UI state and the shell will not
be usable. There will be no echo, no cursor, and no scrollback. (You
can manually fix it with <kbd>"stty sane"</kbd> and <kbd>"echo ^v ESC
c"</kbd>) This cleanup problem is common to all UI environments, be it
curses, console, the framebuffer, or X. Crashing the UI environment
without cleanup is a very bad idea. It's also pretty bad for your
objects in general, possibly resulting in leaking resources, memory, IPC
resources, etc. Most object oriented UI frameworks take care of this for
you in some way. Some require an application object, which is guaranteed
destructed on exit; you can see an example implementation of this approach
in the <tt>test</tt> directory. Some just register <var>atexit()</var>
functions to clean up anything that really needs to be cleaned up. And
then there are those who just assume nothing bad will ever happen and
that the user knows how to reboot. Try not to fall into the last category.
